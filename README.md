Dear recruiters of Vinted Data Science and Analytics Academy,

I want to share some graded assignments I did for the course Data Analytics because the skills I developed through making these could be relevant for the Data Science and Analytics Academy position.

In this course, I learned to implement Python code to transform, model, and analyze tabular datasets and identify and create appropriate visualizations in Python to explore data patterns. Some of the libraries used to accomplish this included numpy, pandas, plotnine, statsmodels, and sklearn.
